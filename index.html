            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As a Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe honoree in Manufacturing and Industry, I, Dr. Joyjit Chatterjee, have established myself as a pioneer in developing AI products that revolutionize energy and manufacturing processes. My journey in AI and data science spans multiple countries, sectors, and disciplines, making me a truly global innovator.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, I serve as an IT & Digital Data Scientist - Continuous Improvement at Reckitt, a multinational FMCG company behind renowned brands like Air Wick, Dettol, and Lysol. In this role, I innovate applied AI solutions for supply chain optimization, focusing on minimizing waste, optimizing quality, and enhancing productivity through advanced process optimization techniques.</p>
            
            <p>My previous role as an R&D Data Scientist (KTP Associate) at Reckitt saw me developing novel AI models for shelf-life prediction and optimization of healthcare formulations. This project was awarded the "Certificate of Excellence - Outstanding" by Innovate UK and was highlighted as a KTP success story by Ashorne Hill, showcasing the real-world impact of my work.</p>
            
            <p>My expertise extends beyond the corporate world. With an extensive background in data-driven operations and maintenance in the wind industry, I received the prestigious Green Talents Award from the German government for my outstanding contributions to AI R&D in this sector. This work has garnered attention from global platforms such as Forbes, the World Economic Forum, Times of India, and IEEE, underlining its significance in the field of sustainable energy.</p>
            
            <p>Recognized as a Global Talent by UKRI and the UK Home Office, I frequently provide voluntary AI advice to C-Suite Executives, Civil Servants, and Academic Institutions. My global perspective is further enhanced by my experience as an expert reviewer on European Commission projects.</p>
            
            <p>My academic journey is equally impressive. As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hull, UK, I built upon my PhD in Computer Science, which focused on explainable AI for wind turbine maintenance. My educational background also includes a PGDip in Research Training from Hull, a Professional Certificate in AI from Oxford, and a CPD Course in Business from Cambridge. I began my journey as a Gold Medalist in B.Tech Electronics & Communication Engineering from Amity University, India.</p>
            
            <p>I've left my mark in the academic world with numerous publications in top-tier AI and engineering venues, including leading conferences like NeurIPS and KDD, and reputed journals from Wiley, Elsevier, and Cambridge University Press. As a top-cited author, I've also filed patents with renowned researchers and delivered talks on global platforms.</p>
            
            <p>My international experience includes roles as a Visiting Researcher at the University of Bremen, Germany, and Tamkang University, Taiwan, working on government-funded projects. I regularly serve on committees for leading conferences and journals, bringing a global perspective to these academic forums.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond my technical expertise, I'm a certified Scrum Master and an avid globetrotter, continuously seeking new challenges and perspectives. My accolades include the Best International Knowledge Exchange Award, PhD Scholarship, Employability Award from Hull, grants from IEEE and Microsoft, Global Impact Challenge Scholarship from Nudge (Netherlands), Young Researcher Award from IEEE UK & Ireland, and several awards from my alma mater, Amity University.</p>
            
            <p>My research interests encompass cutting-edge areas of AI, including Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Graphs, Causal Inference, and Time-Series Analysis. Through my work, I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI, driving innovation across industries and contributing to a more efficient, sustainable future.</p>
